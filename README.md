# PhD_thesis
This repository contains all my work for my PhD thesis "Co-occurrence of modal markers in Latin: a quantitative and qualitative analysis". 

## Notes about **SOURCE FILES**
- Sallust contains Bellum Iugurtinum; Bellum Catilinae; but also Orationes and Epistulae (not part of the corpus, delete those texts from processing)
- Cicero's Philippicae also contains Pro Milone, Pro Marcello, Pro Ligario, Pro rege Deiotaro. These are not part of the corpus, delete them before text processing

## Notes about **TXT FILES**
- histo_all contains also Bellum Hispanicum, which takes it up to 132k tokens. This probably unbalances the corpus. none of the co-occurrences extracted from this work is modal. probably take it out for the final version of the corpus
